# Rethinking the Invisible â€“ Miguel Castro

A poetry-chapbookâ€“style portfolio that reveals reframed problems and invisible signals.

This isnâ€™t just a website. Itâ€™s a living systemâ€”where design, technology, and storytelling converge to challenge assumptions and surface blind spots.

## âœ¨ About

**Miguel Castro** is a two-time Cannes Lions Innovation winner, including a **Grand Prix in Innovation**. His work operates at the intersection of creativity, systems thinking, and speculative designâ€”framing whatâ€™s overlooked and giving form to the invisible.

This site is a living manifesto. It breathes. It fades. It questions.

Each section is treated like a poem. Every project is a reframed problem. Nothing is here just to be seenâ€”itâ€™s here to be felt.
